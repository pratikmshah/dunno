# iDunno
Is a collection of notes, snippets and links for reference and additional resource. (design based on Google simple, clean and fast)

##### Notes/Links for:
- Booststrap 3 (boot3)
- Command Line Interface (cli)
- Cascading Style Sheets (css)
- Git (git)
- Hyper Text Markup Language (html)
- Javascript (js)

##### To Use
1. Download the files and double click on index.html in the root folder.
2. In search box select the topic you want and then query a search.
3. You can click on the link to open up main link to that topic or
   click on main topic heading to view additional resources.
- NOTE: If you are using Firefox you can use this without having to worry about cross-origin resource sharing.
  However, with chrome you will need to either start a simple server or disable CORS. [Click here for information on how to resolve CORS issue](https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2014/08/bypass-cors-errors-testing-apis-locally/).

##### Bugs/Improvments
- visuals are plain and simple as of right now
- firefox selection box is off by a couple of pixels
- search results are not 100% perfect (working on ability to add tags for each topic)
- need to refactor shows pages and improve speed
- working on adding modals to keep everything inside one window instead of opening new tab.
- large screens show results a little too far to the left vs on laptop (working on media queries)
